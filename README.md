## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the prices of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, and clarity. Utilizing machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Linear Regression, the project offers an interactive web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to input diamond characteristics and receive price estimations.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly interface developed with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
- **Multiple Prediction Models**: Implementation of both KNN and Linear Regression algorithms for price prediction.
- **Dataset Included**: A comprehensive dataset of diamonds is provided for training and evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of data distributions and model performance.

## Repository Structure

- `Dataset/diamonds.csv`: The dataset containing diamond features and prices.
- `Streamlit/app.py`: The main script to run the Streamlit web application.
- `Streamlit/requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the Streamlit app.
- `Diamond_Price_Prediction_KNN_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing the KNN regression model development.
- `Diamond_Price_Prediction_Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing the Linear Regression model development.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
